The distribution of the time_to_close is right skewed.

In the graphic below you can see that this outlier is dominating the data and making comparison difficult. To make it easier to compare the rest of the data, we will remove this outlier.\n![with outliers box plot](with%20outliers%20box%20plot.png)\nAfter removing the outliers . we can now consider the distribution of each location . we can see from the figure below that all locations (RECIFE,FORTALEZA,SAO LUIS , NATAL) have the same median with around 185 days\n![without outliers](without%20outliers.png)\nAlthough there are some differences between each location the legal team should focus on RECIFE because it has around 886 cases with median 185 days time_to_close.This would suggest that the legal team have to make sure they have enough resource/staff for the coming 6 months.\nFurther analysis should consider the factor of poisoning cause , Is it due meat or vegtable for each location and see if the type of posioing affecting the amount paid.","metadata":{},"id":"170dd2ea-340f-4ab4-94c8-fe077342e98e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## ✅ When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
